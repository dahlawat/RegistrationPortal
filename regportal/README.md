# Student Registration Portal

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.1.2.
Being just a beginner in Angular I tried to generate the right structure for this project.
The test suite given along is not reliable given my limited exposure to the Angular technology.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
The application has been configured to call the Spring-Boot based backend present at http://localhost:9090 to perform the supported operations.
The backend application supports the CORS functionality without any additional security token configuration within both the applications.
